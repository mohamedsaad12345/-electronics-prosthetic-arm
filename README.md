 What is the objective of the project ?
 The goal of the smart prosthetic limb project is to improve the quality of life for individuals who have lost their limbs by
 providing innovative technological solutions that enable them to regain the ability to move and control naturally. This
 prosthetic limb relies on muscle signals, allowing users precise control and smooth movements that resemble natural
 limbs.
 
 electronics prosthetic arm
 As my capstone project, I designed and developed a prosthetic limb prototype that mimics the functionality of a human
 limb. The key feature of this project was utilizing electromyography (EMG) sensors to translate electrical signals from
 the user's muscle movements into control inputs for the prosthetic.I designed and integrated the EMG sensor system,
 which captures the muscle signals and converts them into control commands for the microcontroller. This allows the
 prosthetic limb to respond intuitively to the user's intended movements.
